    Array variable is pointer to the first element of array.
    We can refer to an element of an array as following:

        printf("address of array: %p\n", message);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", message[2]);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", *(message + 2));
    
    We can skip the array elements as following:

        char message[] = "Hello friends?!";
        puts(message + 6); // prints starting from "f", "friends?!"

        message[3] == *(message + 3) == *(3 + message) == 3[message]
