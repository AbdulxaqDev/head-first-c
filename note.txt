    Array variable is pointer to the first element of array.
    We can refer to an element of an array as following:

        printf("address of array: %p\n", message);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", message[2]);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", *(message + 2));
    
    We can skip the array elements as following:

        char message[] = "Hello friends?!";
        puts(message + 6); // prints starting from "f", "friends?!"

        message[3] == *(message + 3) == *(3 + message) == 3[message]
    
    We can get user input with scanf:

        char name[40];
        printf("Enter your name: ");
        scanf("%39s", name); // gets up to 39 character and \0
    
    We can get numeric values:

        int age;
        printf("Enter your age: ");
        scanf("%i", &age);

    We can get multiple inputs at once:

        char first_name[20];
        char last_name[20];
        printf("Enter your first and last name: ");
        scanf("%19s %19s", first_name, last_name);
        printf("First: %s, Last: %s\n", first_name, last_name);
    
    If we forget to set limit in scanf and user inputs more data than supposed
    it causes buffer owerflow

    We can use fgets(), so we can not forget to set the size of input
    because fgets() signiture requires to set maximum input size then it works

        char food[5];
        printf("Enter favorite food: ");
        fgets(food, sizeof(food), stdin);
        printf("%s\n", food);

    String litiral never can be updated. String literals are stored in read-only memory.

[May 5, 2024]
    The C language orovides some ready libraries to save our time. One of them is
    string.h library. It specialised to work with strings. It contains functions, which 
    can help up to work with strings. It containes following functions:

    - strchr() - finds a char in string
    - strstr() - finds substring
    - strlen() - returns length of string

    We can redirect standart input and output to a file with ">" and "<" respectively.

    ./geo2json < gpsdata.csv > output.json

    "<" - redirects standart inout to a file
    ">" - redirects standart output to a file
    "2>" - redirects standart error to a file

    Here we are redirecting the gpsdata to standart input of geo2json and redirecting
    the standard output of geo2json to output.json

    But, there is one problem. The problem is when the geo2json encounters an error while processing
    passed data, it writes the error message also to output json file. And nothing will be noticable
    in terminal. To prevent this and output the error to terminal, we can use fprintf().

    fprintf() is general version of printf():

    printf("Hello there!");
    fprintf(stdout, "Hello there!"); // here we can change use stderr, stdout.

    above the code outputs the same output. We can specify the outpout type with fprintf(outType, "Output");

    While redirecting all standard outputs of geo2json to a json file, we can output the error to standard error
    stream. So, the standars error stream aways outputted to rerminal.

    printf("Error!"); // redirected to file
    fprintf(stderr, "Error"); // redirected to display/terminal

    We can redirect only the standard error with "2>".

    Outputting multiple files
    We can creat a stream on fly. Each data stream is represented by a pointer to a file.
    And, we can create a new data stream with "fopen()" function:

    FILE *in_file = fopen("input.txt", "r");

    This will create a data stream to read FROM file here. fopen() gets two arguments,
    the first one is file name and second one is the "r" reading mode. Total, there are
    three modes, "r" is reading, "w" is writing and "a" is appending mode.

    FILE *out_file = fopen("output.txt", "r"); // creates stream in read mode

    here is the stream to write to a file.

    To make it simple, the fopen() function creates streams in different modes (read, write and append).
    fscanf() reads different types of streams, any file also can be read as a stream. Here, the fscanf() function
    reading a file pointer as a stream.
    The fscanf() function reads stream:

        int fscanf(FILE *ptr, const char *format, ...);

    The fprintf() function is the same with fscanf(), but opposite of the fscanf(). It outputs stream in different 
    wats, here it is outputting a file.
    The fprintf() function writes stream:
    
        int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)
[May 20, 2024]
    We can get command line arguments as main function arguments.
    The main function gets arguments as array of strings, and length of that array.

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]){} // argc is a number of elemets and argv is array of strings that cli arguments.

    So, c provides a special function that handles cli command in a confortable way.
    It is getopt(argc, argv, "d:t"), this function returns a character.
    So we can iterate it with file:

            char ch;

            while ((ch = getopt(argc, argv, "d:t")) != EOF)
                switch (ch)
                {
                case 'd':
                    delivery = optarg;
                    break;
                case 't':
                    thick = 1;
                    break;
                defautl:
                    fprintf(stderr, "Unknown option: '%s'\n", optarg);
                    return 1;
                }
[May 22, 2024]

    So, the C languhe has different types based on the data type, which reqiueres different memory size.

    They are char, short, int, long, float and double.

    The short can not handle int or long numbers, becuase of its memory allocation is small.

    Almost, all types based on numbers: integer and float. Even characters are registered on computer memory as numbers.
    computer sees 65 as "A" letter.

    Header files.

    If we want to use one source code in seperate file, we need to create it is header file.

    For example, we have following function in seperate logger.c file:

        void logger(char *message)
        {
            printf("%s", message);
        }
    
    And we need to create header file called logger.h and we keep the signiture of the function
    in that header file:

        void logger(char *message);

    and need to include the header file in the c file as following:

        // inside logger.c file
        #include "logger.h"

    And, to use the logger function in other.c file, we need to include it is header:

        // inside other.c file
        #include "logger.h"

    The last one, we need to compile files toger which are included with gcc:

        gcc other.c logger.c -o all

    Object files

    As project gets bigger, files get more and more. And, the time to compile that project gets bigger.
    To prevent this kind of time consuming, we can compile of all files to object files. Then we can link them
    together to create executable file.

    The benefit of compiling each file to object, if we upcate one of the source files, we just need to recompole that
    updated file to object file again instead of all sources files then link them together to generate executable file.

    This prevents us to recompile all unchanged files and saves compilation time.

    Make 

    We have a tool called make, it helps us to automate the compilation of only updated files and make executable
    file.

    Every file that make compiles is called "target".

    Every target need be told two things:

        1. the dependencies
            which files the target is going to be generated from.
        2. the recipe
            the set of instructions it needs to run to generate file.
    Together, those two form the rule. A rule tells to make all what to do.

[May 25, 2024]
    Make

    The tool make can track updated files and only recompiles updated files only.
    That saves compilation time.
[May 27, 2024]
    Struckts, Unions and Bitfields

    Struct can hold different types of data.
    we can create a struct as following:

    struct fish {
        const char *name;
        const char *species;
        int teeth;
        int age;
    };

    The name and species properties that only hold the pointer to strings.
    When we assign to another vriable, we just telling to computer to copy that data.

    Struct can have another struct as a property, it is called nesting. Following:

        struct exercise
        {
            const char *description;
            float duration;
        };

        struct meal
        {
            const char *ingredients;
            float weight;
        };

        struct preferences
        {
            struct meal food;
            struct exercise exercise;
        };

        struct fish
        {
            const char *name;
            const char *species;
            struct preferences care;
        };

    As you can see, we need to use the "struct" keyword always when we use it, even inside of another struct.
    To get rid of being wordy like that, we can use "typedef" keyword to create alias to a struct in c, as following:
    (struct with alias, without name is also called anonymous struct)

        typedef struct cell_phone {
            int cell_no;
            const char *wallpaper;
            float minutes_of_charge;
            } phone;

        or
        
        typedef struct { // without struct name, only type name
            int cell_no;
            const char *wallpaper;
            float minutes_of_charge;
            } phone;


    then we can use this "phone" type without "struct" word as following:

        phone p = {5557879, "sinatra.png", 1.35};
[June 3, 2024]
    Unions
    Unions can hold different type of data types. But, one data type, it can hold.
    To creat a union, we use union keyword

        typedef union {
            short count;
            float weight;
            float volume;
        } quantity;

        quantity q = {.count = 5};
        q.weight = 5.5;
    
    On memory, union takes memory for one type, which gets biggest place;
    Because, it targets the biggest type size to allocate memory.
[June 4, 2024]
    Enum
    Enum is similar is to struct, but it sets number(kind of index) to its each prperty, called symbols. 
    If we use enum, union and struct together:

        typedef enum
        {
            COUNT,
            KILOGRAM,
            LITRE,
        } unit_of_measure;

        typedef union
        {
            short count;
            float weight;
            float litre;
        } measure;

        typedef struct
        {
            const char *name;
            measure amount;
            unit_of_measure units;
        } fruit;

    based on enum, we can know which type of union is used

    Bitfields
    Some times we want to store only yes or no value or 1 or 0.

    if we user short:

    short isTrue = 0; // 00000000

    As you can see, even  with short type, if we only want 0 or 1, it uses 2 bytes of
    memory, waste of memory.

    With bitfields we can use just one bit for that kind of case.
    To use it, we need to group that kind of variables to struct, then struct stores 0 and 1
    consequitivly in memory. Bitfields can store a custem number of bits.

    To use bitfields in struct, integer should be unsigned:

        typedef struct {
            unsigned int first_visit: 1;
            unsigned int come_again: 1;
        } survey;
    
[June 5, 2024]
    Flexible data
    Linked list, we can implement linked list with struct in C language.
    One thing, we need to set struct name for a struct to make pointer for it.
    We can not use only typedef, if we use struct pointer, need to provide struct name
    with alias name.

        typedef struct island
        {
            char *name;
            char *opens;
            char *closes;
            struct island *next;
        } island;

        island amity = {"Amity", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
        island craggy = {"Craggy", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
        island isla_nublar = {"Isla Nublar", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
        island shutter = {"shutter", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};

        amity.next = &craggy;
        craggy.next = &isla_nublar;
        isla_nublar.next = &shutter;

        // inserting
        island skull = {"Skull", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
        isla_nublar.next = &skull;
        skull.next = &shutter;
[June 7, 2024]
    Dynamic memory
    We can ask for an amount of memory to locate data in C, with malloc() function.
    to use it, we need to include stdlib.h header. When allocate memory with malloc() function
    we need to free that allocated memory, with free() function.
[June 14, 2024]
    Valgrind, checking leaks.

    valgrind is a linux program that checks leaks. It intercepts the malloc and free, and keeps track of those
    functions. Checks all located and freed data, if any left in heap, it gives all information about it.
    If there is no any leaks, it ensures that a program does not have any leaks.

    as I am using linux subsystem on one device, WSL does not have valgrind in my case.
    To install it:

    $ apt-get install valgrind

    to check leaks on a programm:

    first compile the program with debug mode:

    $ gcc -g -o program program.c

    second check the leaks on that program:

    $ valgrind -s --leaks-check=full ./program

    -s shows all error and --leaks-check=full gives full detailed information.

    in mack book, we use "leaks" program instead of "valgrind"
[June 15, 2024]
    Function pointers

    Every function name in C language is a pointer, which points to code in memory.
    We can use function pointers to pass a function to a function as a paramater.
    And, we can create function pointer variables to store function pointer and use that
    variable as the function it is pointing to.

    We can declare a functio variable as following:

    returnType (*functionName)(funcParamType);
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>

        char *text = "William: SBM GSOH likes sports, TV, dining";

        int sports(char *s)
        {
            return strstr(s, "sports") != NULL;
        }

        int arts(char *s)
        {
            return strstr(s, "arts") != NULL;
        }

        void find(int (*match)(char *))
        {
            if(match(text))
                puts(text);
        }

        int main()
        {
            int (*pFunc)(char *);
            pFunc = sports; // here the match_fn works as sports.
            
            find(arts);
            find(pFunc);
            
            return 0;
        }
    As above, we can pass a function to a function as an argument and use it.
    And, we can declare function pointer variable to store a function pointer and 
    use it as that function.
[June 18, 2024]
  Function pointer array
  So we can use function pinters to make code more compact

    enum tResponse{ DUMP,  SECOND_CHANCE, MARRIAGE };

    typedef struct {
      const char *name;
      enum tResponse type;
    }  response;

    void dump(response r){
      puts(r.name);
      printf("you are dump, so the relationship is finished\n", r.name);
    }

    void second_chance(response r){
      puts(r.name);
      printf("you are lucky, so you have a second chance\n", r.name);
    }

    void marriage(response r){
      puts(r.name);
      printf("you are AMAZING, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A MARRIAGE\n", r.name);
    }

    void (*replies[])(response) = { dump, second_chance, marriage };
    response r[] = {
      { "Brendan", MARRIAGE },
      { "Jpohn", DUMP },
      { "Jonatan", SECOND_CHANCE },
      { "Bekham", DUMP }
    };

    int main()
    {
      for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
          puts("--------");
          (replies[r[i].type])(r[i]);
      }
      puts("--------");

      return 0;
    } 
   
     As we can see above, we are using functions as an array of (function) pointers.
    And, we can iterate through the function pointers at the same time through responses.
