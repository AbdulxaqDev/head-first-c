    Array variable is pointer to the first element of array.
    We can refer to an element of an array as following:

        printf("address of array: %p\n", message);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", message[2]);
        printf("3st element of array: %c\n", *(message + 2));
    
    We can skip the array elements as following:

        char message[] = "Hello friends?!";
        puts(message + 6); // prints starting from "f", "friends?!"

        message[3] == *(message + 3) == *(3 + message) == 3[message]
    
    We can get user input with scanf:

        char name[40];
        printf("Enter your name: ");
        scanf("%39s", name); // gets up to 39 character and \0
    
    We can get numeric values:

        int age;
        printf("Enter your age: ");
        scanf("%i", &age);

    We can get multiple inputs at once:

        char first_name[20];
        char last_name[20];
        printf("Enter your first and last name: ");
        scanf("%19s %19s", first_name, last_name);
        printf("First: %s, Last: %s\n", first_name, last_name);
    
    If we forget to set limit in scanf and user inputs more data than supposed
    it causes buffer owerflow

    We can use fgets(), so we can not forget to set the size of input
    because fgets() signiture requires to set maximum input size then it works

        char food[5];
        printf("Enter favorite food: ");
        fgets(food, sizeof(food), stdin);
        printf("%s\n", food);

    String litiral never can be updated. String literals are stored in read-only memory.
